LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U_adder/count_9999[15]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U_adder/count_9999_reg[0]/CLR, U_adder/count_9999_reg[10]/CLR,
U_adder/count_9999_reg[11]/CLR, U_adder/count_9999_reg[12]/CLR,
U_adder/count_9999_reg[13]/CLR, U_adder/count_9999_reg[14]/CLR,
U_adder/count_9999_reg[15]/CLR, U_adder/count_9999_reg[1]/CLR,
U_adder/count_9999_reg[2]/CLR, U_adder/count_9999_reg[3]/CLR,
U_adder/count_9999_reg[4]/CLR, U_adder/count_9999_reg[5]/CLR,
U_adder/count_9999_reg[6]/CLR, U_adder/count_9999_reg[7]/CLR,
U_adder/count_9999_reg[8]/CLR (the first 15 of 16 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
