WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 U_RAM/mem_reg has an input control pin U_RAM/mem_reg/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: U_RAM/Q[5]) which is driven by a register (U_APB_Master/temp_addr_reg_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
